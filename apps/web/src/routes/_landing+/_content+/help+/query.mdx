Sweetreply, unlike many other platforms, goes further than positive and negative keywords. We support an advanced lucene-like syntax that allows:

-   Case sensitivity
-   Wildcards
-   Boolean operators
-   Grouping

Although our query system may sound intimidating, it's actually quite simple. Let's break multiple scenarios for a fictional lawn mowing service company called "Mow and Go".

Mow and Go is a lawn mowing service company based in California. They want to search for all mentions that contain the word `lawn`, `mowing` and `california`. However, Mow and Go only mows lawns, they do not repair lawn mowers. They will want to exclude any post that includes the word `repair`

---

## Keywords

**_Simplest type of query_**

If you want to use Sweetreply with simple positive and negative keywords, we've got you covered.

Here is how Mow and Go would configure their query to search for all mentions that contain the word `lawn`, `mowing`, and `california`, but not `repair`

```
lawn mowing california -repair
```

<Stack mb="sm">
	<SocialMatch
		content="I am looking for a lawn mowing service in California!"
		pos={["lawn", "mowing", "California"]}
		neg={["repair"]}
		isMatch={true}
	/>
	<SocialMatch
		content="I am looking for place to repair my lawn mower in California!"
		pos={["lawn", "mowing", "California"]}
		neg={["repair"]}
		isMatch={false}
	/>
</Stack>

**Note**
This query is case insensitive, meaning `california` and `California` are treated the same

If you wanted to make this case sensitive and only match a post with "California" capitalized surround it in quotations

```
lawn mowing "California" -repair
```

---

## Intermediate examples

You can also use Sweetreply's boolean operators `AND | OR` for more advanced queries.

This query works the exact same as the previous case insensitive example using boolean operators

```
lawn AND mowing AND california NOT repair
```

This query will match any post that contains the words `service | company | crew`, `lawn` and 'california', while still excluding any posts containing `repair`

```
lawn AND mowing AND (service OR company OR crew) AND california NOT repair
```

<Stack mb="sm">
	<SocialMatch
		content="I am looking for a lawn mowing service in California!"
		pos={["lawn", "mowing", "service", "California"]}
		neg={["repair"]}
		isMatch={true}
	/>
	<SocialMatch
		content="I am looking for a lawn mowing company in California!"
		pos={["lawn", "mowing", "company", "California"]}
		neg={["repair"]}
		isMatch={true}
	/>
	<SocialMatch
		content="I am looking for a lawn mowing crew in California!"
		pos={["lawn", "mowing", "crew", "California"]}
		neg={["repair"]}
		isMatch={true}
	/>
	<SocialMatch
		content="I am looking for a lawn mowing gang in California!"
		pos={["lawn", "mowing", "California"]}
		neg={["gang"]}
		reason="The post is missing service, company, or crew"
		isMatch={false}
	/>
</Stack>

---

## Advanced examples

**_When you need complete control_**

### Wildcards

It is likely that Mow and Go will want to search for variations of the word "mow" such as "mowing" and "mower". To do this, they can use the wildcard operator `*`

```
lawn mow* california -repair
```

<Stack mb="sm">
	<SocialMatch
		content="I am looking for a lawn mowing service in California!"
		pos={["lawn", "mowing", "California"]}
		neg={[]}
		isMatch={true}
	/>
	<SocialMatch
		content="I am looking for a lawn mower service in California!"
		pos={["lawn", "mower", "California"]}
		neg={[]}
		isMatch={true}
	/>
</Stack>
