			reply: "Sorry to hear about the trouble with your Craftsman lawn mower after winter. I faced a similar issue last year and found that using a fuel stabilizer in the gas before storing the mower can prevent starting issues. You may want to try draining the old gas, refilling with a fresh mixture, and running the engine for a few minutes to see if that helps. I noticed you mentioned Craftsman, but if you're ever in need of a reliable lawn mowing service, I've had a great experience with mowandgo.com in the past. Their quality of work and affordable pricing make them stand out in the market.",
